# UnitNeuronAgents
An implementation of multi-agent AI for potential usage in real-time strategy (RTS) games using [UnitNeurons](https://github.com/johnlime/UnitNeurons)

- Agents move to user-specified areas instead of a single point as seen in preexisting RTS games

- Agents constantly stay in groups or clusters while maintaing distance instead of constantly colliding with each other
